## üìñ About The Project

Ever wondered if your PC can handle the latest AAA titles? This project aims to answer that question. The PC Gaming Readiness Checker is a user-friendly, web-based tool that provides a detailed analysis of a computer's gaming capabilities.

Unlike simple checkers that only look at the CPU and GPU, this application takes a holistic approach, considering the entire system's balance‚Äîincluding RAM, storage, motherboard tier, power supply, and even the CPU cooler. It then provides a clear, easy-to-understand verdict based on your target gaming resolution (1080p, 1440p, or 4K), along with a prediction for its future relevance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using a simple and powerful front-end stack:

- **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling and layout, providing a modern, utility-first approach.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the application logic, including the scoring system, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application's logic is based on a weighted scoring system:

1.  **Component Scoring:** Every component option in the dropdowns (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) is assigned a score based on its relative performance in a modern gaming context. The GPU and CPU have the highest weight in this calculation.
2.  **Target Score:** Each gaming resolution (1080p, 1440p, 4K) has a "target score" that a well-balanced PC should aim for to achieve a good experience.
3.  **Performance Ratio:** The tool calculates your PC's `totalScore` by adding up all your component scores. It then divides this by the `targetScore` of your chosen resolution to get a performance ratio.
4.  **Verdict Generation:** Based on this ratio, the application generates a final verdict, from "Not Recommended" to "Excellent," and also checks for potential bottlenecks (like a weak PSU with a powerful GPU) to add specific warnings.
